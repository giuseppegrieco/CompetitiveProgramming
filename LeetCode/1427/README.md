## Perform String Shifts

You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [directioni, amounti]:

directioni can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).
amounti is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.
